========== ~ TASK BRIEF ~ ==========  
Robot will start a distance of 1m from a seaker with its orientation determined by a judge.
There will be a bright Red LED fixture for it to locate ~5cm away from a music source.

1. Rover must reach the LED before the end of the music; if not, the distance is measured to
the rover at the time the music stops.
2. Distance is measured from the closest part of the robot to the LED
3. There is a 5cm penalty added to the final distance for touching the speaker or the LED stand.
